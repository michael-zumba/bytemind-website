### Why SaaS Companies are Getting Caught
Many New Zealand founders believe that if they don't have a physical office in the US, they don't owe US tax. This is dangerously incorrect.

Since the *South Dakota v. Wayfair* ruling, states can charge sales tax based on **economic nexus**—simply selling enough dollars or transactions into a state triggers a tax obligation.

#### Key Thresholds to Watch
*   **California:** $500,000 in sales.
*   **New York:** $500,000 in sales AND 100 transactions.
*   **Texas:** $500,000 in sales.

If you cross these, you must register, collect, and remit sales tax. Failure to do so can result in penalties of 30% or more on top of the unpaid tax.

### What Should You Do?
1.  **Audit your sales by state.** Use Stripe or Xero to export your customer location data.
2.  **Monitor thresholds.** If you are approaching $100k in any single state, start planning.
3.  **Automate.** Tools like Avalara or TaxJar can help, but they need to be configured correctly.
