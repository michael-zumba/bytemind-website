### The Problem: Accidental Tax Bills
Founders often focus 100% on product and 0% on tax structure. When a US private equity firm offers $50M for your company, you suddenly realize:

1.  **Your IP is stuck in the wrong place.** Moving it now triggers a taxable event.
2.  **Your Cap Table is messy.** Early employees have options that aren't tax-efficient.
3.  **You face double taxation.** If you sell assets instead of shares, the company pays tax, and then you pay tax on dividends.

### The Solution: The "Clean HoldCo"
Setting up a holding company structure early can save millions. By separating IP from operations, you can:
*   License IP to different markets efficiently.
*   Isolate liabilities.
*   Provide a clean vehicle for acquisition.

**Don't wait until the Letter of Intent (LOI).** Fixing structure 2 months before a sale is often impossible or extremely expensive. Do it now.
